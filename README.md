Thank you for the oppurtunity for me to showcase my data visualization skills via Python programming and Pandas for this interview at Schroder's investment. This GitHub repository contains all the work I did for 
this assesment including a .py file for all the methods and classes, the Jupyter Notebook iteslf as well as the initial instructions and excel spreadsheet which I converted to a .csv file for my notebook to
read as an input. Please note that I was unable to do the heatmap correctly but if you look at the methods file you could see my functionality.

In order to view my work you must download this repository and either create a folder called Schroder's in your Google Drive or modify the Jupyter Notebook code to match your Google drive. This way I could assure you 
that the Python code I wrote works.

I used the Pandas library as means of manipulating and visualizng raw data as brought up in the first interview.

Thank you again, and I look foward to hearing from you.
